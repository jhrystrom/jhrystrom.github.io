Back in the good old days of plentiful Twitter API access, I investigated how best to model the spread of new concepts on Twitter. Specifically, I tested the sociology-inspired SEIZ model versus the simpler SI model. 

In a nutshell, I found that SEIZ does indeed matter (it provides a better fit) but that it's equally important how you use it (it provides rich interpretations of the parameters). 

While the work was solo-authored I am greatly indebted to conversations with my professor [Fabio Trecca](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5900-7616).
